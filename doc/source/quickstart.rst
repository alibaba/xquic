Quick Start
===========

For this quick start we assume the following prerequisites:

* breathe was downloaded and extracted somewhere
* doxygen was installed and doxygen output (XML format) was generated for the
  project that is to be documented (set GENERATE_XML tag to YES)

We assume the following paths:

* documentation root path: :file:`/home/me/docproj/`
* breathe path: :file:`/home/me/docproj/ext/breathe/`
* doxygen xml output: :file:`/home/me/docproj/doxyxml/`
