# Interop

All contents below this directory is only used for the interop project of the QUIC working group, which requires a much more strict run-time environment and is not advised to be used for testing.

If you are that much curious about these codes, you shall be aware of the interop project.
If you insist on running the interop client or server, you shall learn how to set up the run-time environment, and use the shell commands in run_endpoint.sh to execute interop client or server.
If you are interested in the interop project, see
* [quic-network-simulator](https://github.com/marten-seemann/quic-network-simulator) for building a docker image.
* [quic-interop-runner](https://github.com/marten-seemann/quic-interop-runner) for setting up the environment and running the project.
